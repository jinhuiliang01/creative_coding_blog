# My three artworks about high and low compressibilities and high effective complexity.

To the question why might this be useful for the purposes of making generative art?
My answer is that this kind of subjectivity makes the generated art more flexible and interactive, allowing the audience to interpret the work from their own point of view, as everyone's aesthetics and received knowledge are unique, so they will first substitute themselves into the work. This makes the art more diverse and resonant.

This one is my artwork about high compressibility.

<iframe id="high compressibility" src="https://editor.p5js.org/jinhuiliang01/sketches/bQxevYc5p"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`high compressibility`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

</script>

This one is my artwork about low compressibility.

<iframe id="low compressibility" src="https://editor.p5js.org/jinhuiliang01/sketches/AqJx7AVys"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`low compressibility`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

</script>

This one is my artwork about high effective complexity.

<iframe id="high effective complexity" src="https://editor.p5js.org/jinhuiliang01/sketches/Bo-ZGA4MO"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`high effective complexity`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

</script>

In my third example, the concept I use is about creating different patterns but lay in order, triangle face to different angle. For code, I use these codes:

These code help me create chaotic and odered elements.

# Discuss the work about the artist I picked.

I picked the work from Rosa Menkman. His structure is very obvious, everything is neat and tidy, nothing messy appears. Randomness is reflected in the ripples, and there is no moment when the ripples are repeated. Basically it's a regular movement, but at the same time the ripples inside the black colour block are full of randomness and instability, and you never know where it will go next. Therefore, this work is complex, but also effective, and it can express the author's intention without being too noisy and ruining the audience's enjoyment of the work.
