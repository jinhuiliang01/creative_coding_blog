# This is a description of the kindred spirit for whom my assignment 1 is offering.

1. The context of my kinship: I hope I am making this piece for my future girlfriend.
2. The common purpose: We can all feel each other's love, so I'm going to make this direct love heart.
3. Shared challenge: The person I like is not in the same city or even the same country as me, so the biggest challenge is the distance. I want to be able to express things in a straightforward way.

# The connection between how my chosen kindred spirit may understand or relate to the visual, sonic, and interactive elements of my assignment 1 idea.

Visual: As I am very direct in my expression, I basically do not have to guess what I am going to say. As well as the colours I chose are her favourite colours, so it is noticeable.

Sound： For background music, I might choose the accompaniment of her favourite song to give her a direct sense of what I'm trying to convey, and then the interactive sounds are just common.

Interactive： She likes cool, three-dimensional things, so orbit control is a good choice to have a three-dimensional environment to interact with.

I've now added a colour gradient to the previous one to make it look a bit cuter as well as less monotonous. I'll wait until next week to search the tutorials online or see if the lecturer will talk about it in class.

Chatgpt, Claude and Deepseek are the tools to help me understand the meaning of the code. And I also learn some of the function from the Youtube turorials and p5.js references.

# The recreation of the artwork 'Falling Falling'

Here are the comments of my understanding to 'Falling Falling'

My tools are mainly the reference interface of p5.js and the w3school website, and then if I can't find the results I want, I ask chatgpt, which explains very well what each piece of code means.
