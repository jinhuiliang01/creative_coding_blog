# This is a revisit of the work by Rafael Rozendaal and how he did that in a cute way.

I chose his work "Only Suddenly".

1. Visually: I think visually his work is super clean and only use squares and a circle. Of the color, he use different kind of grey and it is unify. And I think maybe these are some kind of cute.
2. Sonically: When the circle reach the edge of the square, it would have a tone of the bells and it is different every time. And there are about six or seven different tones.
3. Interactively: There's no much interactive thing. When I open the window and it is automatically running. According to a fixed speed, once the circle touches the edge, it will rebound to the other side, which is in line with the principle of physics from a certain angle, and it is also a kind of lovely expression I think.

# This is how I plan to achieve my assignment 1

1. Visually: I plan to continue the way of what I have done with my assignment 1. The colour using I think is cute though, they are all light colours. And I also remove the black stroke which makes it cuter.
2. Sonically: I plan to add some sound effect when clicking the mouse.
3. Interactively: I plan to take the feedback from my collegue Mataso. He thinks if I can heart beat with my mouse press would be better. I would try to do that.

# These are some feedbacks from my collegue

Questions:

1. How well did you achieve a cute aesthetic?
2. What could you try to increase the cuteness?
3. How might you use implement these improvements using javascript?

Mataso:

1. Visually, very cute. Did well in the colors. Sonically, not yet. Interactively, alright, he likes the 3D movement but not sure it is cute.
2. Visually, get rid of the black boxes. Interactively, I need to key press with heart beat.
3. Key press will help my interactivity. For the assignment I also need to add classes.
