3. How might you use implement these improvements using javascript?

Mataso:

1. Visually, very cute. Did well in the colors. Sonically, not yet. Interactively, alright, he likes the 3D movement but not sure it is cute.
2. Visually, get rid of the black boxes. Interactively, I need to key press with heart beat.
3. Key press will help my interactivity. For the assignment I also need to add classes.
