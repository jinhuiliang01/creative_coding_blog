# This is the document about the discussions with my classmates in class.

Questions:

1. What do you think is going on, under the hood?
2. What concepts would I need to understand in order to replicate this work in p5?
3. What resources might help me to learn those concepts?

Sam:

1. The thing going on is two cols, and one square in each cols that move, and then when they hit the middle they change the direction.
2. Variables and change the x and y coordinates overtime and for loops and if and else statements.
3. W3schools, Youtube and Google.

Kunzes:

1. Two squares with no stroke move to each other. When they hit the middle they change the direction.
2. How to speed it up and slow it down. And also how to do when mouse press then change the colours.
3. The references of p5 itself and Google.

Mataso:

1. For the colour, they are using the on press function to create interactivity. For the movements, they are increasing the x by the framecount.
2. The press function.
3. P5 references.
