# This is my thinking how I might go about making cute visuals, cute sounds and cute interactions.

As for cute visuals, I would choose soft and pastel colour like light pink and light blue. And I think it needs to be some tiny decorative details like heart shape. And it could use orbit control, which means using mouse or touch input to adjust camera orientation in a 3D sketch. And the shapes would be the heart shapes.

As for cute sounds, I would probably use high-pitched “boop” or “pop” sound when mouse clicking. And maybe play some slow sweet song for the background music.

As for the interactions, I would let the heart shape change the colour when the mouse is hanging on the shape.
