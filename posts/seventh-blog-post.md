# This is how I plan to reach the concepts of my assignment 1.

Variables: I use variables like cubes, cubeSize, heartSize, etc., and also local variables within functions.

Functions: I use defined several functions like setup(), draw(), generateCubeHeart(), drawCubeHeart(), getGradientColor(), etc. For which can help me set up different functions of interactions.

Iterations: I use loops (for loops) extensively in my code, such as in generateCubeHeart() and updateGradientColors(). They can help me form the color grading automatically.

Boolean Logics: I use it to form my heart shape from 2D into 3D through mathematic calculating.

Arrays: I add arrays to track cube colors. I use it for store the current colors, store the target colors for transitions and also control the speed of colors transitions.

Classes: I modify generateCubeHeart and drawCubeHeart to use the cube clases. Help me to generate the 3D heart shape with cubes.

# Discuss the questions about the draft.

Questions:

1. How well did you achieve cuteness in the visual, sonic, and interactive domains?

I think it's visually cute because it's a heart, plus the colour scheme and the background colour is light, Sonically I added a high frequency sound effect when clicking the mouse, so I think it's cute too, Interactively, every time I click the mouse, the heart will beat once, and there's a sound effect coming out, so it's really cute. Interactively, the heart of the mouse will beat once every time you click on it, and a sound effect will come out, so I think it's also cute.

2. What communities and learning resources did you draw on to do the bulk of your learning for this project?
   Most of my learning for this project came from the p5js reference function, YouTube, and Google, and I relied on Google to help me with some of the functions, such as generating flat love hearts. Then YouTube is for some tutorials and reference helps me find some functions. To be honest, I also use AI tools to help me, such as deepseek and chatgpt, which help me find bugs in my programmes and fix them, and sometimes they help me with parts of the code that I don't understand online.

3. What aspects have you enjoyed the most about this process? What have you found to be most surprising?

My favourite part of the process was the moment I made the 3D love heart, because I felt rewarded for my efforts, and then the most surprising part was when I went to improve the heartbeat function after Mataso gave me the feedback, I felt very surprised because it wasn't in my plan, but now it came out very good. I was surprised because it wasn't in my plan, but now it's working very well.

4. What aspects have you struggled with the most? What have you found the most confusing?

The biggest headache would have to be finding the desired shape when I look for the function of a love heart. Then the most confusing part was how to turn the 2D hearts into 3D ones. I looked for a lot of tutorials and googled this, but many of them didn't have any videos that exactly met my expectations, so the time spent on this was the longest. I also tried to use AI tools to generate a 3D love heart for me, but the result was not satisfactory. I asked my friend, who is a programmer, to help me with the code, and he taught me how to make a 2D heart into 3D.

And here is the rough draft of my assignment 1.

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`assignment 1 draft`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42
